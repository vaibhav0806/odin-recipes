    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pancakes come in many different shapes, sizes, and flavors. 
        They can be sweet, savory, thick, thin, small, or large, but they are all delicious! While there are many styles of pancakes, 
        we like to keep it classic with traditional American-style pancakes.

        You can have your choice of Banana, 
        Craisin and Granola, Blueberry, Apple and Pecan, or Cinnamon and Roasted Pecan served fresh off the griddle with butter and maple syrup. YUM!
