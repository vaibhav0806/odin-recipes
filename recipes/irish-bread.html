    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This simple Irish classic is a staple in many households, used to mop up hearty stews and wash down pots of tea. 
        It’s also a symbol of celebration, baked in droves in the lead up to Saint Patrick’s Day. 
        However, the humble soda bread began as an affordable necessity and was the solution to many food problems facing Ireland at the time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While soda bread is most famously attributed to Ireland, it was actually first created by Native Americans. 
        They were the first to be documented using pearl ash, a natural form of soda formed from the ashes of wood, to leaven their bread without yeast.

        The Irish later discovered and replicated the process. 
        While it seems like an ancient recipe, Irish soda bread history began in the 1830s, when baking soda, or bicarbonate soda, was first introduced to the country.
