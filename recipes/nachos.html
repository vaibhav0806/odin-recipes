    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Nachos are a non-traditional Northern Mexican regional dish born in the 1940s that consists of fried tortilla chips or 
        totopos covered with melted yellow American cheese (or cheese sauce), often served as an American snack or appetizer. 
        More elaborate versions of the dish include other ingredients, and may be substantial enough to serve as a main dish. Ignacio "El Nacho" 
        Anaya created the dish in 1940.[6][7] The original nachos consisted of fried corn tortilla chips covered with melted cheese and sliced jalape√±o peppers.
